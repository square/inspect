#### inspect

inspect command line is a utility that gives a
brief overview on current state of system resource
usage and ability to dig through details. 

Supported platforms: linux, MacOSX 10.9

inspect aims to evolve to be an intelligent tool that
can spot problems.

Currently it can spot few easy ones:
  * process X is throttled on CPU because of cgroup restrictions
  * System wide resource usage problems (disk/cpu/mem/net)


###### Installation

1. Get go
2. go get -v -u github.com/square/inspect/inspect # fetches packages and builds

###### Server 

*inspect* can be run in server mode to run continously and expose metrics via HTTP JSON api

./bin/inspect  -server -address :12345

```
s@c62% curl localhost:12345/api/v1/metrics.json 2>/dev/null

###### Todo
  * Rules for inspection need to seperated out into user supplied code/config. Currently inspect command line has hard-coded guesswork
  * PerProcessStat on darwin doesn't include optimizations done for Linux. 
  * Command line utility needs much nicer formatting and options to dig into per process/cgroup details
  * Add caching support to reduce load when multiple invocations of inspect happen.
